## About

<p align="left">
	Hi! My name is Omid. I'm a rising junior at Yale University studying math and computer science. I love solving hard engineering problems, and am deeply interested in ways that technology can improve human lives.
</p>

	I'm co-president of <a href="https://codehavenyale.com">Code Haven</a>, an initiative to increase access to computer science for middle school students in New Havenâ€”to date we have taught CS fundamentals to over 200 students in 7 middle school classrooms. I also study autonomous vehicles with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5sTqxqb3wQ&feature=youtu.be">YDriving</a>, building self-driving vehicles and applying formal verification techniques to make them safer.

	At the moment, I'm a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>. I've also built fullstack websites and mobile apps at the <a href="https://www.joinhorizons.com/">Horizons School of Technology</a> and worked as a TA for my school's Algorithms course (CS365).
