## About

<p align="left">
	Hi! My name is Omid. I'm a rising junior at Yale University studying math and computer science. I love solving hard engineering problems, and am deeply interested in ways that technology can improve human lives.
</p>

<p align="left">
	I'm co-president of <a href="https://codehavenyale.com">Code Haven</a>, an initiative to increase access to computer science for middle school students in New Haven—to date we have taught CS fundamentals to over 200 students in 7 middle school classrooms. I also study autonomous vehicles with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5sTqxqb3wQ&feature=youtu.be">YDriving</a>, building self-driving vehicles and applying formal verification techniques to make them safer.

	At the moment, I'm a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>. I've also built fullstack websites and mobile apps at the <a href="https://www.joinhorizons.com/">Horizons School of Technology</a> and worked as a TA for my school's Algorithms course (CS365).

  Some past accomplishments I'm proud of: co-organizing a <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Students-find-a-common-language-with-computer-12873213.php">CS fair</a> for 150 middle schools students, giving a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZUBfOMZ9zQ">talk on violin + beatboxing</a> at TEDx RB High, and recording a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/midooholfada/beginnings">musical trio</a> I wrote.
